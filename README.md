## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

See working progress on [Bloccit](http://brad-bloccit.herokuapp.com/).

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitignore as well.
